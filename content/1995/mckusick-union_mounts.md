**Abstract**:
This paper describes the design and rationale behind
union mounts, a new filesystem-namespace management
tool available in 4.4BSD-Lite. Unlike a traditional
mount that hides the contents of the directory on which
it is placed, a union mount presents a view of a merger
of the two directories. Although only the filesystem
at the top of the union stack can be modified, the
union filesystem gives the appearance of allowing any-
thing to be deleted or modified. Files in the lower
layer may be deleted with whiteout in the top layer.
Files to be modified are automatically copied to the
top layer.

This new functionality makes possible several new
applications including the ability to apply patches to
a CD-ROM and eliminate symbolic links generated by an
automounter. Also possible is the provision of per-
user views of the filesystem, allowing private views of
a shared work area, or local builds from a centrally
shared read-only source tree.
