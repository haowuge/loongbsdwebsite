This talk goes through the current state of the FreeBSD audio subsystem,
with a focus on recent Foundation-sponsored work undertaken by the
presenter during the past months, as part of an effort to modernize
FreeBSD audio and audio application development. It covers important
changes and additions, such as the implementation of new userland audio
development libraries and more user-friendly utilities, as well as
kernel driver bug fixes and behavior improvements. It also showcases
some real examples of audio production setups using FreeBSD as their
operating system of choice.
